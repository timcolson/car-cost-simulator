# Car Cost Simulator

A playground with starter code for a car cost simulator proejct. 

Work through the pages and provide functions to simulate the real world expenses associated with owning a car. This project will help students apply Swift functions, conditionals (if/else), XCTest cases, loops, and String interpolation. 

In addition, there is a task to provide some mockups of an app that compares two vehicles, perhaps in a combat style comparison. See which one wins the smackdown of cost!
