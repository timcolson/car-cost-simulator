 ## Insurance
 
 In the US, we can't drive cars without insurance. If you have a loan, the lender (Bank, Credit Union) will require full coverage which is more expensive.

 * Experiment:
   Write a function to return a cost of insurance (Double):
   - Provide two rates, based on driver age (under 21, or over)
   - Add 20% more for a "truck" type
