 ## Insurance
 ![Crash Test](crash-test-1620591_1920_crop.jpg)
 In the US, we can't drive cars without insurance. Age factors into the cost. And, if you have a loan for the car, the lender (Bank, Credit Union) will require full coverage, which is usually more expensive.

 * Experiment:
   Write a function to return a cost of insurance (Double):
   - Provide two rates, based on driver age (under 21, or over)
   - Add 20% more for a "truck" type of vehicle.
