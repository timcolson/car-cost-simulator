 # App Mockups
![Mockup Sketch](car_simulator_sketch.jpg)

 The second part of the project is to make some visual sketches for an app. Use an **iPad** as the target device, to give yourself a bit more room.

 ## Screens to include:
 
1) Data Input & Basic Results Screen
2) Detail Results Screen for one Vehicle
3) Instructions Screen - explain one of the costs
 
 **Remember**: a neatly done hand-drawn sketch is a great way to mockup an app. The whiteboard photo above is admittedly **super rough**; it's there just to start you thinking. Be creative! 
 
 AddOn: try a tool like moqups.com
