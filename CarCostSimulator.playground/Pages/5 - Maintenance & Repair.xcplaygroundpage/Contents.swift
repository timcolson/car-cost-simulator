 ## Maintenance & Repair
 
 Most cars have a warranty that covers most problems in the first 3 years, but even during that period, there is a cost for routine oil changes and filters, windshield wiper blades, not to mention parking.
 
 * Experiment:
 Write a function to return a cost of maintenance & repair (Double) based on this formula:
    * $100/year for oil filters/changes every year
    * Add $1000/year from year 4-7
    * Add $2000/year from year 8+
